### 1. CommonJS Build (dist/cjs/index.cjs)
‚úÖ **PASSED** - All compound assignment operators work correctly
- Test file: `test-cjs.js`
- Browser extension pattern: Works
- Multiple compound assignments: Works
- Result: 100% success

### 2. ESM Build (dist/esm/index.js)
‚úÖ **PASSED** - All compound assignment operators work correctly
- Test file: `test-esm.mjs`
- Browser extension pattern: Works
- Multiple compound assignments: Works
- Complex real-world patterns: Works
- Result: 100% success

### 3. Browser UMD Build (dist/browser/wang.min.js)
üìù **READY FOR BROWSER TESTING**
- Test file: `test-simple-browser.html`
- Open in browser to verify
- Tests browser extension pattern
- Tests all compound operators

## Test Coverage

The following compound assignment operators have been verified:
- `+=` (addition assignment)
- `-=` (subtraction assignment)
- `*=` (multiplication assignment)
- `/=` (division assignment)

## Browser Extension Compatibility

The exact pattern used by the browser extension has been tested:
```javascript
let __inputs = {}
let x = 10
x += 5
__result = x
```

This pattern works correctly in all build formats.

## Conclusion

Wang-lang v0.7.1 has successfully fixed the compound assignment operator issues. If the browser extension is still experiencing issues with compound assignment:

1. **Ensure v0.7.1 is installed**: The extension may be using an older cached version
2. **Clear any caches**: Browser extension caches, npm caches, or build caches
3. **Rebuild the extension**: With the latest wang-lang v0.7.1
4. **Verify the build output**: Check that dist/browser/wang.min.js is from v0.7.1

## How to Test Browser Build

1. Open `test-simple-browser.html` in a browser
2. Check the browser console for test results
3. Both tests should show "‚úÖ TEST PASSED!"

## Next Steps

If the browser extension continues to have issues after confirming v0.7.1 is in use:
1. Check the exact error message and line number
2. Verify the wang-lang import/loading method in the extension
3. Check for any transpilation or bundling issues in the extension build process
